## Project Overview
Having a portfolio website offers numerous compelling advantages over documenting a CV and a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-mandila/) profile, especially for someone with diverse expertise and professional experiences. For me, these advantages include the following seven:

1. ***Professional Showcase***: A portfolio website serves as a centralized, professional showcase of skills, achievements, and experiences, illustrating the scope and impact of work, especially in the nuanced fields of data analytics, program management, and leadership
2. ***Evidence of Skills***: For roles that involve digital competence, having the ability to create a website with dynamic and responsive layout and data collection and analytics features is proof of mastery of diverse digital tech tools.
3. ***Dynamic and Up-to-date***: Unlike a resume, my portfolio website will be continuously updated with my latest projects and engagements, which ensures that my professional profile is always current and reflective of professional growth and expertise.
4. ***Thought Leadership***: As an enthusiast in data analytics, data product management, and leadership, having a platform to share insights, blog posts, or case studies can become a resource for others in the field.
5. ***Facilitates Networking and Connection***: A personal website can be a networking hub, where other professionals, mentors, mentees, and potential collaborators come to learn about my work and connect with me.
6. ***Efficient Communication Tool***: When networking or applying for new roles, sharing a link to my portfolio is a highly efficient way to communicate my professional stature and capabilities, much more so than attaching documents or describing my work in brief conversations.

7. ***Reflects Personal Growth***: The "Sagacity Spectrum" serves as a personal record of my professional journey. It's not just a tool for others to assess my capabilities, but also a platform for me to reflect on my growth, achievements, and the evolution of my career goals and aspirations.
