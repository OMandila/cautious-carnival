## Project Overview
Having a portfolio website offers numerous compelling advantages over documenting a CV and a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-mandila/) profile, especially for someone with diverse expertise and professional experiences. For me, these advantages include the following seven:

1. ***Professional Showcase***: A portfolio website serves as a centralized, professional showcase of skills, achievements, and experiences, illustrating the scope and impact of work, especially in the nuanced fields of data analytics, program management, and leadership
2. ***Evidence of Skills***: For roles that involve digital competence, having the ability to create a website with dynamic and responsive layout and data collection and analytics features is proof of mastery of diverse digital tech tools.
3. ***Dynamic and Up-to-date***: Unlike a resume, my portfolio website will be continuously updated with my latest projects and engagements, which ensures that my professional profile is always current and reflective of professional growth and expertise.
4. ***Thought Leadership***: As an enthusiast in data analytics, data product management, and leadership, having a platform to share insights, blog posts, or case studies can become a resource for others in the field.
5. ***Facilitates Networking and Connection***: A personal website can be a networking hub, where other professionals, mentors, mentees, and potential collaborators come to learn about my work and connect with me.
6. ***Efficient Communication Tool***: When networking or applying for new roles, sharing a link to my portfolio is a highly efficient way to communicate my professional stature and capabilities, much more so than attaching documents or describing my work in brief conversations.
7. ***Reflects Personal Growth***: The "Sagacity Spectrum" serves as a personal record of my professional journey. It's not just a tool for others to assess my capabilities, but also a platform for me to reflect on my growth, achievements, and the evolution of my career goals and aspirations.

  - Favicon image was generated by DALL.E in ChatGPT-4
  (Prompt: *An image of the universe depicted as a spiral of space dust, with a distinct red Google pin marking the location of Earth among the space dust particles. The image should be visually striking and suitable for use as a favicon, capturing the essence of the universe with a focus on Earth's location. The background should be a deep space view, with swirling dust and stars, and the red pin should be clearly visible, symbolizing Earth's position in the vast cosmos. The image should be high-resolution to ensure clarity and detail, even when scaled down for favicon use.*) 
  and converted to favicon format through https://favicon.io/

## Bugs
### Resolved bugs
1. The responsiveness issue in small screens below 350px width: 
    - As shown in the image below, the home/landing page left a white gap on the right-side when the user tried to view on a 280px width screen.
![image](https://github.com/OMandila/sagacity-spectrum/assets/71443713/1182564c-3afc-4685-a0c3-e4f349995c80)
    - This was resolved by reducing the letter-spacing in the footer from 2px to 0, and reducing the font-size of 'Favourite Organizations' from 200% to 140%
